# MILESTONE 2 - Design of a Single Cycle RISC-V Processor

In this milestone, students are tasked with designing a single-cycle RV32I processor, as discussed in lectures. The processor is implemented with the ISA RV32I, excluding FENCE
instructions. To enable communication between your custom processor (soft-core) and external peripherals, some modifications to the standard processor design are necessary. The standard peripherals it
must support are LCD, LEDs, and SWITCHes; seven-segment LEDs are optional. In order to accommodate the lecture, for memory, the processor utilizes two identical logic element memory models.
One is read-only for the instruction memory, while the other isread-write for the data memory. The design must adhere to the specifications outlined below and will be tested against both student-created
testbenches and a comprehensive testbench provided by the TA. Adherence to the suggested specifications, while not mandatory, is strongly recommended. This milestone provides the timeline for students to follow,
so that they can complete their processor within four weeks. For undergraduate students, there is an additional penalty week to fulfill the milestone requirements.

## Week 1: ALU and BRC

## Week 2: Regfile, Memory, and LSU
